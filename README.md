# Farcaster Frames for Polymer by yurakas97

The repository contains 2 folders. "dapp" is responsible for the back-end side. And "my-frame" for creating and validating frames.

This project uses Frog.fm framework to create and process frames, and ERC721 token standards, oppenZeppelin lib. and custom solidity smart contracts.

**Utility:** The user can send transactions with messages from Base to Optimism through the frame using the IBC channel and interact with packet sending process over there.

How it works(video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jljusQy0V7s


## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites


- Have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- Have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed (v20+)
- Have [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed (Hardhat will be installed when running `npm install`)
- Have [just](https://just.systems/man/en/chapter_1.html) installed (recommended but not strictly necessary)
- Have npm installed

Some basic knowledge of all of these tools is also required, although the details are abstracted away for basic usage.

## ðŸ’» Installation

After cloning the repository: 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yurakas97/f-frames.git
```
run this command additionally:
```bash
npm install express
```
```bash
npm install -D typescript
```
```bash
npm install frog hono
```

To **run the back-end server**, there are a couple of things to do. (Assuming the dependencies have been installed). Go to "dapp" folder
```bash
cd dapp
```
Convert the `.env.example` file into an `.env` file.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Add your private keys and config path:
```bash
CONFIG_PATH='config/message-dapp.json'
```

Once the configuration file is updated and saved, you can set and deploy contracts.

- ```nvm use 20```
- ```just set-contracts base BaseContract``` and
- ```just set-contracts optimism OptContract false```
- ```just deploy base optimism``` to deploy.
- ```just create-channel``` to create a custom IBC channel.

## ðŸ’» How to run

Use a second terminal or screen to run there app.js server that will listen to requests from the frame validator and send packets through IBC.
```bash
node app.js
```
Return to the first terminal and go to "my-frame" dir.
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
